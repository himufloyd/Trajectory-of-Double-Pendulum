In the intersection of physics and machine learning, we delve into the intriguing world of complex systems like the double pendulum. These systems exhibit chaotic behavior, as witnessed in simulations. Our venture into forecasting such intricate systems using deep learning architectures showcases the potential of AI algorithms in addressing complex challenges within the natural sciences. These tools offer novel avenues, replacing the laborious, manual approaches of the past.

Our focus was on predicting the position of the double pendulum's bob, leveraging inputs such as initial positions and rod lengths. We harnessed the power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to train on the initial positions and bob movements, enabling us to extrapolate the bob's trajectory. Extensive experimentation with various double pendulum parameters led to the development of an optimal system capable of achieving desired positions or paths. This achievement signifies a breakthrough in tackling complex scientific problems, offering promising applications in diverse domains.

Our innovative approach was not limited to the double pendulum. We extended it to forecast the trajectory of projectiles, utilizing inputs like initial positions, velocities, and launch angles to train the RNN.

In the foreseeable future, we envision adapting and expanding these projects to predict the behavior of highly unstable systems, such as weather patterns or health-related issues. The fusion of physics and machine learning opens doors to a new realm of possibilities in understanding and managing intricate systems, propelling us toward more accurate predictions and informed decisions.
